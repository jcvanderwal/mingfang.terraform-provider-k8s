# resource "k8s_storage_k8s_io_v1beta1_csi_storage_capacity"

CSIStorageCapacity stores the result of one CSI GetCapacity call. For a given StorageClass, this describes the available capacity in a particular topology segment.  This can be used when considering where to instantiate new PersistentVolumes.

For example this can express things like: - StorageClass "standard" has "1234 GiB" available in "topology.kubernetes.io/zone=us-east1" - StorageClass "localssd" has "10 GiB" available in "kubernetes.io/hostname=knode-abc123"

The following three cases all imply that no capacity is available for a certain combination: - no object exists with suitable topology and storage class name - such an object exists, but the capacity is unset - such an object exists, but the capacity is zero

The producer of these objects can decide which approach is more suitable.

They are consumed by the kube-scheduler if the CSIStorageCapacity beta feature gate is enabled there and a CSI driver opts into capacity-aware scheduling with CSIDriver.StorageCapacity.

#### capacity

######  TypeString

Capacity is the value reported by the CSI driver in its GetCapacityResponse for a GetCapacityRequest with topology and parameters that match the previous fields.

The semantic is currently (CSI spec 1.2) defined as: The available capacity, in bytes, of the storage that can be used to provision volumes. If not set, that information is currently unavailable and treated like zero capacity.
#### maximum_volume_size

######  TypeString

MaximumVolumeSize is the value reported by the CSI driver in its GetCapacityResponse for a GetCapacityRequest with topology and parameters that match the previous fields.

This is defined since CSI spec 1.4.0 as the largest size that may be used in a CreateVolumeRequest.capacity_range.required_bytes field to create a volume with the same parameters as those in GetCapacityRequest. The corresponding value in the Kubernetes API is ResourceRequirements.Requests in a volume claim.
## metadata

Standard object's metadata. The name has no particular meaning. It must be be a DNS subdomain (dots allowed, 253 characters). To ensure that there are no conflicts with other CSI drivers on the cluster, the recommendation is to use csisc-<uuid>, a generated name, or a reverse-domain name which ends with the unique CSI driver name.

Objects are namespaced.

More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

    
#### annotations

######  TypeMap

Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations
#### creation_timestamp

######  ReadOnly • TypeString

CreationTimestamp is a timestamp representing the server time when this object was created. It is not guaranteed to be set in happens-before order across separate operations. Clients may not set this value. It is represented in RFC3339 form and is in UTC.

Populated by the system. Read-only. Null for lists. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata
#### deletion_grace_period_seconds

######  ReadOnly • TypeInt

Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only.
#### deletion_timestamp

######  ReadOnly • TypeString

DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested. Read-only. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata
#### labels

######  TypeMap

Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and services. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels
#### name

######  TypeString

Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names
#### namespace

######  TypeString

Namespace defines the space within which each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty.

Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces
#### resource_version

######  ReadOnly • TypeString

An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used for optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a resource or set of resources. Clients must treat these values as opaque and passed unmodified back to the server. They may only be valid for a particular resource or set of resources.

Populated by the system. Read-only. Value must be treated as opaque by clients and . More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency
#### self_link

######  ReadOnly • TypeString

SelfLink is a URL representing this object. Populated by the system. Read-only.

DEPRECATED Kubernetes will stop propagating this field in 1.20 release and the field is planned to be removed in 1.21 release.
#### uid

######  ReadOnly • TypeString

UID is the unique in time and space value for this object. It is typically generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not allowed to change on PUT operations.

Populated by the system. Read-only. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids
## node_topology

NodeTopology defines which nodes have access to the storage for which capacity was reported. If not set, the storage is not accessible from any node in the cluster. If empty, the storage is accessible from all nodes. This field is immutable.

    
## match_expressions

matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed.

    
#### key

###### Required •  TypeString

key is the label key that the selector applies to.
#### operator

###### Required •  TypeString

operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values. Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.
#### values

######  TypeList

values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn, the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist, the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic merge patch.
#### match_labels

######  TypeMap

matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed.
#### storage_class_name

###### Required •  TypeString

The name of the StorageClass that the reported capacity applies to. It must meet the same requirements as the name of a StorageClass object (non-empty, DNS subdomain). If that object no longer exists, the CSIStorageCapacity object is obsolete and should be removed by its creator. This field is immutable.
