## metadata

Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

    
#### annotations

######  TypeMap

Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations
#### creation_timestamp

######  ReadOnly • TypeString

CreationTimestamp is a timestamp representing the server time when this object was created. It is not guaranteed to be set in happens-before order across separate operations. Clients may not set this value. It is represented in RFC3339 form and is in UTC.

Populated by the system. Read-only. Null for lists. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata
#### deletion_grace_period_seconds

######  ReadOnly • TypeInt

Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only.
#### deletion_timestamp

######  ReadOnly • TypeString

DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested. Read-only. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata
#### labels

######  TypeMap

Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and services. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels
#### name

######  TypeString

Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names
#### namespace

######  TypeString

Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty.

Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces
#### resource_version

######  ReadOnly • TypeString

An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used for optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a resource or set of resources. Clients must treat these values as opaque and passed unmodified back to the server. They may only be valid for a particular resource or set of resources.

Populated by the system. Read-only. Value must be treated as opaque by clients and . More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency
#### self_link

######  ReadOnly • TypeString

SelfLink is a URL representing this object. Populated by the system. Read-only.

DEPRECATED Kubernetes will stop propagating this field in 1.20 release and the field is planned to be removed in 1.21 release.
#### uid

######  ReadOnly • TypeString

UID is the unique in time and space value for this object. It is typically generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not allowed to change on PUT operations.

Populated by the system. Read-only. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids
## spec

Specification of the desired behavior for this NetworkPolicy.

    
## egress

List of egress rules to be applied to the selected pods. Outgoing traffic is allowed if there are no NetworkPolicies selecting the pod (and cluster policy otherwise allows the traffic), OR if the traffic matches at least one egress rule across all of the NetworkPolicy objects whose podSelector matches the pod. If this field is empty then this NetworkPolicy limits all outgoing traffic (and serves solely to ensure that the pods it selects are isolated by default). This field is beta-level in 1.8

    
## ports

List of destination ports for outgoing traffic. Each item in this list is combined using a logical OR. If this field is empty or missing, this rule matches all ports (traffic not restricted by port). If this field is present and contains at least one item, then this rule allows traffic only if the traffic matches at least one port in the list.

    
#### port

######  TypeString

The port on the given protocol. This can either be a numerical or named port on a pod. If this field is not provided, this matches all port names and numbers.
#### protocol

######  TypeString

The protocol (TCP, UDP, or SCTP) which traffic must match. If not specified, this field defaults to TCP.
## to

List of destinations for outgoing traffic of pods selected for this rule. Items in this list are combined using a logical OR operation. If this field is empty or missing, this rule matches all destinations (traffic not restricted by destination). If this field is present and contains at least one item, this rule allows traffic only if the traffic matches at least one item in the to list.

    
## ipblock

IPBlock defines policy on a particular IPBlock. If this field is set then neither of the other fields can be.

    
#### cidr

###### Required •  TypeString

CIDR is a string representing the IP Block Valid examples are "192.168.1.1/24" or "2001:db9::/64"
#### except

######  TypeList

Except is a slice of CIDRs that should not be included within an IP Block Valid examples are "192.168.1.1/24" or "2001:db9::/64" Except values will be rejected if they are outside the CIDR range
## namespace_selector

Selects Namespaces using cluster-scoped labels. This field follows standard label selector semantics; if present but empty, it selects all namespaces.

If PodSelector is also set, then the NetworkPolicyPeer as a whole selects the Pods matching PodSelector in the Namespaces selected by NamespaceSelector. Otherwise it selects all Pods in the Namespaces selected by NamespaceSelector.

    
## match_expressions

matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed.

    
#### key

###### Required •  TypeString

key is the label key that the selector applies to.
#### operator

###### Required •  TypeString

operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values. Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.
#### values

######  TypeList

#### match_labels

######  TypeMap

matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed.
## pod_selector

This is a label selector which selects Pods. This field follows standard label selector semantics; if present but empty, it selects all pods.

#### policy_types

######  TypeList

List of rule types that the NetworkPolicy relates to. Valid options are "Ingress", "Egress", or "Ingress,Egress". If this field is not specified, it will default based on the existence of Ingress or Egress rules; policies that contain an Egress section are assumed to affect Egress, and all policies (whether or not they contain an Ingress section) are assumed to affect Ingress. If you want to write an egress-only policy, you must explicitly specify policyTypes [ "Egress" ]. Likewise, if you want to write a policy that specifies that no egress is allowed, you must specify a policyTypes value that include "Egress" (since such a policy would not include an Egress section and would otherwise default to just [ "Ingress" ]). This field is beta-level in 1.8
